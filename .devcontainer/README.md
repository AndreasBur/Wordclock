# Wordclock development containers

VS Code offers two configurations when running **Dev Containers: Reopen in
Container**:

- **Wordclock Simulator (Linux/X11)** for native Linux and remote environments.
- **Wordclock Simulator (WSL2/WSLg)** when VS Code runs in WSL2. This forwards
  the WSLg X11, Wayland and PulseAudio sockets from `/mnt/wslg`.

Choose the configuration matching the host. Keeping the WSLg mount in its own
configuration prevents native Linux container startup from failing when
`/mnt/wslg` does not exist.
