# Wordclock

## Code conventions

These are observed throughout the existing code — follow them rather than
reformatting to a different taste.

### Prefer small functions

Split an expression into named steps instead of leaving a block of inline
arithmetic. A step whose name explains it is worth a function even when it is
called exactly once, and the name then carries the meaning that a comment would
otherwise have to.

Such helpers live in the class body in the header, so they inline:

```cpp
static constexpr ColorType dimmColor(ColorType Color, byte Brightness) {
    return static_cast<ColorType>((static_cast<uint16_t>(Color) * (Brightness + 1u)) >> 8u);
}
```

`static` when the helper does not touch members, `constexpr` on top of that when
the body allows it — a helper calling a non-`constexpr` function (or `std::sqrt`)
stays plain `static`. The caller then reads as a pipeline:

```cpp
const byte Level = toLevel(getWeightedIntensity(getIntensity(Pixel)));
```

### Naming

- Functions `lowerCamelCase`; `get`/`set` for accessors, `to` for conversions
  (`toColour`, `toLevel`), `is` for predicates (`isIndexValid`, `isAnimationValid`).
- Variables, parameters and members `PascalCase`.
- A setter parameter that collides with its member is prefixed `s`
  (`setBrightness(byte sBrightness)` assigning `Brightness`).

### Constants

Class-internal constants are `static constexpr`, not `#define`:

```cpp
static constexpr byte UnlitLevel{192u};
```

`#define` is reserved for the configuration macros at the top of a header, which
are named after the module (`PIXELS_NUMBER_OF_LEDS`, `PIXELS_SUPPORT_DIMMING`).

### Comments

Comments say *why*, not what — the reasoning that is not recoverable from the
code, such as which alternative was rejected and what went wrong with it. Keep a
comment attached to the function whose behaviour it explains.

## Layout

- `firmware/` — the platform-independent clock, shared by both targets.
- `platform/simulator/` — wxWidgets stand-ins for the hardware (pixel matrix,
  light sensor, Arduino `Serial`), mirroring the hardware classes' public API.
- `.devcontainer/` — one `Dockerfile` plus a `devcontainer.json` per host
  (`linux` for X11, `wslg` for WSL2); shared editor settings live in the local
  `shared/` feature.

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DPLATFORM=simulator
cmake --build build          # -> build/bin/Wordclock
```
